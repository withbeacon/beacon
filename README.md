	<h1>Beacon</h1>
</div>
<p align="center">Analytics tool built from the future, to be used today.</p>

## Inspiration
Beacon is a fully open source, privacy friendly and blazingly fast analytics tool which actually makes sense. It is made out of frustration from the existing analytics tools in the market, currently either analytics tools are way clunky and slow or lighweight with a bad user experience as well as the interface. No one of the analytics tool was *actually* good.

## Features
- 🔒 Privacy friendly - GPDR and CCPA compliant
- ❤️  Fully open source and built with community
- 🔥 Heavenly fast (<1.5KBs)
- 🤩 Gorgeous and super simple user interface
- 📎 Sharable dasbhoards

## Contributing

## FAQs
<details>
  <summary>Why would I use it over google analytics?</summary>
  Well, there are several reasons, firstly it just sucks in terms of privacy and speed. GA collects Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and uses cookies, so clearly, if you do not have ToS and Privacy Policy in your website and you are using GA, you are using it illegaly, but whereas Beacon on the other hand, is completely GDPR and CCPA compliant. Secondly, GA is terrible for your users. The script which you embed in your script while using GA is *>44KBs*, whereas the script which you embed in your website while using Beacon is just *<1.5KBs*.
